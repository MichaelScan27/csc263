<h1>HTML</h1>

<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.</p>

<h2>Brief history</h2>

<p>In 1990, as part of his vision of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee defined the concept of hypertext, which Berners-Lee
    formalized the following year through a markup mainly based on SGML. The IETF began formally specifying HTML in
    1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995. In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the W3C to develop the Web.
    In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2 Recommendation a year later. HTML 4.0 was
    released in 1999 and became an ISO standard in 2000.</p>

<p>At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of XHTML, prompting the founding of an independent group called
    WHATWG in 2004. Thanks to WHATWG, work on HTML5 continued: the two organizations released the first draft in 2008
    and the final standard in 2014.</p>

<h2>Concept and syntax</h2>

<p>An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements. Elements are surrounded by matching opening and
    closing tags. Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (&lt;&gt;). There are a few empty or void tags that
    cannot enclose any text, for instance &lt;img&gt;.</p>

<p>You can extend HTML tags with attributes, which provide additional information affecting how the browser interprets
    the element:</p>

<p>An HTML is normally saved with an .htm or .html xtension, is served by a web server, and can be rendered by any Web
    browser.</p>
